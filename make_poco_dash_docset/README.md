A script that creates a [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) docset for [POCO C++ libraries](https://pocoproject.org).

The latest version is automatically downloaded.

Notes:

  * Requires `lxml` (do `pip3 install lxml`).

  * Protected and static methods are listed under "Procedures" and "Statements" categories respectively (chosen purely for ðŸ„¿  and ðŸ…‚ icons), as Dash doesn't have a separate category for private/protected methods.
